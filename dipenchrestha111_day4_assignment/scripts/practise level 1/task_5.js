// Task 5: Explore what is dynamically typed language, 
// and why is js a dynamically typed language.

// A dynamic programming language is a class of high-level programming languages, which at runtime execute many common programming behaviours that static programming languages perform during compilation.

// JS does not require the explicit declaration of the variables before they’re used.
// for example: 
//     In java:
//     static typing :
//         string name; //variables have types
//         name = "john"; //values have types
//         name = 34; //variables cannot change types
        
//     In js:
//     dynamic typing:
//         var name; //variables have no types
//         name = "john";//values have types
//         name = 23;//variables can change dynamically

// when the variable ‘name’ is created, it wasn’t declared with a data type. This allows the ‘name’ variable to be dynamically changed.
