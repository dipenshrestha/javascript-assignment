// Task 4: - Declare two variables using let on the same line without terminating the line and store true value in both the variables and perform addition and show the result on the console and try to analyze the code.

let a = true , b = true ;
let sum = a + b ;
console.log(sum);

// if we assign true then it takes 1
//and if we assign false then it will take 0
